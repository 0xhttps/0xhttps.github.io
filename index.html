                {*tab*} Hello, my name is ihttps.eth and you're probably wondering why you are here. 
                I'm guessing you have clicked a link somewhere, unless you somehow stumbled upon this beautiful site randomly. 
                Regardless, I'm glad you're here. 
                <br>
                <br>
                {*tab*} I started making this site when I realized how dog shit I was with html and css, hoping this would help.
                Surely you can tell I haven't made any progress. Below, you will find some other horrible things I have made.
                Please feel free to shoot me a dm/email (I don't know why you would), but I'm always interested in wasting my time.
                <br>
                <br>
                {*tab*} I will continue adding to this site when I get bored, or come up with any ideas.
                Please give me ideas. Maybe that is what you could email me about. Anyways, that is enough rambling. 
                If you are confused why you are seeing {*tab*} everywhere, it is because when I would place a normal tab, it would not do anything, and I'm too lazy to make it look normal.
                Now I think this looks cool, in a dumb (but cool) way. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Thank you for your time,
                <br>
